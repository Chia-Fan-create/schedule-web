### Class Schedule

An interactive, responsive weekly class schedule built for the 2026 Spring semester at the University of Pittsburgh (MS in Information Science).

#### Features

- Interactive Grid View: A clean weekly visualization of all courses from 8 AM to 9 PM.
- Course Details: Click on any course card to see the full name, instructor, specific timing, and classroom location.
- Color-Coded Subjects: Easy-to-distinguish colors for different courses and departments (e.g., INFSCI and LING).
- Zero Installation: A standalone HTML file that works in any modern browser using React (via CDN) and Tailwind CSS.
- Adaptive Layout: Optimized to fit standard screen sizes for a "single-glance" overview without scrolling.

#### Tech Stack

This project is built as a standalone HTML document, meaning all logic, styling, and icons are handled within one file without needing a complex build environment.

- React (via CDN): Used for component-based UI logic and state management (e.g., modal toggling).
- Tailwind CSS (Play CDN): Used for modern, utility-first responsive styling.
- Lucide Icons: Integrated for clean, minimal iconography.
- Babel (Standalone): Enables the browser to compile JSX directly at runtime.

#### How to Use
